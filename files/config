##
## i3 config file (v4)

##-- Include Config Files ----------------------

## Tilde expands to the user’s home directory:
#include ~/.config/i3/01_theme.conf

## Environment variables are expanded:
#include $HOME/.config/i3/01_theme.conf

## Wildcards are expanded:
#include ~/.config/i3/config.d/*.conf

## Command substitution:
#include ~/.config/i3/`hostname`.conf

## i3 changes the working directory while parsing a config file
## so that relative paths are interpreted relative to the directory
## of the config file that contains the path:
#include 01_theme.conf

## To list all loaded configuration files, run `i3 --moreversion`

#------

## Load i3 config files
include ~/.config/i3/config.d/*.conf

## Enable/Disable i3 bar
#include ~/.config/i3/i3status/statusbar.conf

##-- Mod Keys ----------------------------------
set $MOD Mod4
set $ALT Mod1

##-- General Settings --------------------------

## Floating Modifier
##
## To move floating windows with your mouse, you can either grab their titlebar 
## or configure the so-called floating modifier which you can then press and click
## anywhere in the window itself to move it.
##
## When holding the floating modifier, you can resize a floating window by pressing 
## the right mouse button on it and moving around while holding it.
## If you hold the shift button as well, the resize will be proportional
## (the aspect ratio will be preserved).
floating_modifier $MOD

#------

## Orientation for new workspaces
##
## New workspaces get a reasonable default orientation: Wide-screen monitors 
## (anything wider than high) get horizontal orientation, rotated monitors 
## (anything higher than wide) get vertical orientation.
##
## Syntax: default_orientation horizontal|vertical|auto
default_orientation auto

#------

## Layout mode for new containers
##
## This option determines in which mode new containers on workspace level will start.
##
## Syntax: workspace_layout default|stacking|tabbed
workspace_layout default

#------

## Window title alignment
##
## This option determines the window title’s text alignment. Default is left
##
## Syntax: title_align left|center|right
title_align center

## Print all window titles in format of 'class | title'
for_window [class=".*"] title_format "%class | %title"

## Enable window icons for all windows
for_window [all] title_window_icon off

## Enable window icons for all windows with extra horizontal padding
#for_window [all] title_window_icon padding 5px

#------

## Default border style for new windows
##
## This option determines which border style new windows will have. The default is `normal`.
## Note that `default_floating_border` applies only to windows which are starting out
## as floating windows, e.g., dialog windows, but not windows that are floated later on.
##
## Setting border style to `pixel` eliminates title bars. The border style `normal` 
## allows you to adjust edge border width while keeping your title bar.
##
## Syntax: 
#default_border normal|none|pixel
#default_border normal|pixel <px>
#default_floating_border normal|none|pixel
#default_floating_border normal|pixel <px>
#default_border pixel 2
#default_floating_border pixel 2

#------

## Hiding borders adjacent to the screen edges
##
## You can hide container borders adjacent to the screen edges using `hide_edge_borders`
## (the default is none). Hiding borders is useful if you are using scrollbars, 
## or do not want to waste even two pixels in displayspace.
##
## The `smart` setting hides borders on workspaces with only one window visible, 
## but keeps them on workspaces with multiple windows visible.
##
## The `smart_no_gaps` setting hides edge-specific borders of a container if the
## container is the only container on its workspace and the gaps to the screen edge are 0.
##
## Syntax: hide_edge_borders none|vertical|horizontal|both|smart|smart_no_gaps
hide_edge_borders none

#------

## Smart borders
##
## Smart borders will draw borders on windows only if there is more than one window 
## in a workspace. This feature can also be enabled only if the gap size between 
## window and screen edge is 0.
##
## Syntax: smart_borders on|off|no_gaps
#smart_borders on

#------

## Don’t focus window upon opening
##
## When a new window appears, it will be focused. The `no_focus` directive allows 
## preventing this from happening and must be used in combination with [command_criteria].
##
## Syntax: no_focus <criteria>
#no_focus [window_role="pop-up"]

#------

## Automatically putting workspaces on specific screens
##
## If you assign clients to workspaces, it might be handy to put the workspaces on 
## specific screens. Also, the assignment of workspaces to screens will determine 
## which workspace i3 uses for a new screen when adding screens or when starting 
## (e.g., by default it will use 1 for the first screen, 2 for the second screen and so on).
##
## Syntax: workspace <workspace> output <output1> [output2]…
##
## The `output` is the name of the RandR output you attach your screen to. 
## On a laptop, you might have VGA1 and LVDS1 as output names. 
## You can see the available outputs by running `xrandr --current`
#workspace 1 output LVDS1
#workspace 2 output primary
#workspace 5 output VGA1 LVDS1
#workspace "2: vim" output VGA1

#------

## Interprocess communication
##
## i3 uses Unix sockets to provide an IPC interface. This allows third-party programs
## to get information from i3, such as the current workspaces (to display a workspace bar), and to control i3.
##
## You can override the default path through the environment-variable `I3SOCK` 
## or by specifying the `ipc-socket` directive.This is discouraged, though, 
## since i3 does the right thing by default. If you decide to change it, 
## it is strongly recommended to set this to a location in your home directory
## so that no other user can create that directory.
#ipc-socket ~/.i3/i3-ipc.sock

#------

## Focus follows mouse
##
## By default, window focus follows your mouse movements as the mouse crosses window borders.
## However, if you have a setup where your mouse usually is in your way 
## (like a touchpad on your laptop which you do not want to disable completely),
## you might want to disable `focus follows mouse` and control focus only by using your keyboard.
## The mouse will still be useful inside the currently active window (for example to click on links in your browser window).
##
## Syntax: focus_follows_mouse yes|no
focus_follows_mouse yes

#------

## Mouse warping
##
## By default, when switching focus to a window on a different output 
## (e.g. focusing a window on workspace 3 on output VGA-1, coming from workspace 2 on LVDS-1),
## the mouse cursor is warped to the center of that window.
##
## With the `mouse_warping` option, you can control when the mouse cursor should be warped. 
## `none` disables warping entirely, whereas `output` is the default behavior described above.
##
## Syntax: mouse_warping output|none
mouse_warping none

#------

## Popups during fullscreen mode
##
## When you are in fullscreen mode, some applications still open popup windows (take Xpdf for example).
## This is because these applications might not be aware that they are in fullscreen mode 
## (they do not check the corresponding hint).
## There are three things which are possible to do in this situation.
##
## Syntax: popup_during_fullscreen smart|ignore|leave_fullscreen
popup_during_fullscreen smart

#------

## Focus wrapping
##
## By default, when in a container with several windows or child containers,
## the opposite window will be focused when trying to move the focus over the edge of
## a container (and there are no other containers in that direction) — the focus wraps.
##
## Syntax: focus_wrapping yes|no|force|workspace
# Disable focus wrapping
#focus_wrapping no
# Force focus wrapping
#focus_wrapping force

#------

## Forcing Xinerama
##
## As explained in-depth in https://i3wm.org/docs/multi-monitor.html, some X11 video
## drivers (especially the nVidia binary driver) only provide support for Xinerama 
## instead of RandR. In such a situation, i3 must be told to use the inferior Xinerama
## API explicitly and therefore don’t provide support for reconfiguring your screens 
## on the fly (they are read only once on startup and that’s it).
##
## Syntax: force_xinerama yes|no
#force_xinerama yes

#------

## Automatic back-and-forth when switching to the current workspace
##
## This configuration directive enables automatic `workspace back_and_forth` 
## when switching to the workspace that is currently focused.
##
## Syntax: workspace_auto_back_and_forth yes|no
workspace_auto_back_and_forth yes

#------

## Delaying urgency hint reset on workspace change
##
## If an application on another workspace sets an urgency hint, switching to this 
## workspace might lead to immediate focus of the application, which also means the 
## window decoration color would be immediately reset to `client.focused`. 
## This might make it unnecessarily hard to tell which window originally raised the event.
##
## In order to prevent this, you can tell i3 to delay resetting the urgency state by
## a certain time using the `force_display_urgency_hint` directive.
## Setting the value to 0 disables this feature. The default is 500ms.
##
## Syntax: force_display_urgency_hint <timeout> ms
force_display_urgency_hint 500 ms

#------

## Focus on window activation
##
## If a window is activated, e.g., via `google-chrome www.google.com`, it may request to take focus.
## Since this might not be preferable, different reactions can be configured.
##
## Note that this might not affect windows that are being opened. 
## To prevent new windows from being focused.
##
## Syntax: focus_on_window_activation smart|urgent|focus|none
focus_on_window_activation smart

#------

## Drawing marks on window decoration
##
## If activated, marks on windows are drawn in their window decoration. 
## However, any mark starting with an underscore in its name (_) will not be drawn
## even if this option is activated.
##
## The default for this option is yes.
##
## Syntax: show_marks yes|no
show_marks yes

#------

## Tiling drag
##
## You can configure how to initiate the tiling drag feature.
##
## Syntax:
#tiling_drag off
#tiling_drag modifier|titlebar [modifier|titlebar]
tiling_drag modifier titlebar

##-- Autostart ---------------------------------

## Automatically starting applications on i3 startup
##
## By using the `exec` keyword outside a keybinding, you can configure which commands
## will be performed by i3 on initial startup. `exec` commands will not run when 
## restarting i3, if you need a command to run also when restarting i3 you should
## use the `exec_always` keyword. These commands will be run in order.
##
## Syntax:
#exec [--no-startup-id] <command>
#exec_always [--no-startup-id] <command>
exec_always --no-startup-id ~/.config/i3/scripts/i3_autostart

## The --no-startup-id parameter disables startup-notification support for this particular exec command.
## With startup-notification, i3 can make sure that a window appears on the workspace on which you used the exec command.
